*General steps

1. Run the config.sh script

2. Start Eclipse, then import the following projects:
californium-group-oscore
ace
joint-applications

3. To "ace" add the following folders to the build path*:
californium-core
element-connector
oscore-cf
scandium

4. To "test" add the following folders to the build path:
ace
oscore-cf

*MySQL installation

Note that mySQL is needed for the ace-parts to run correctly. To install it use:
apt-get install mysql-server

Then place a file under ace/db.pwd with the database root password.

*Updating the JCE (Java Cryptography Extensions)

If some of the JUnit tests fail due to "invalid key size" you may need to update the JCE.
