A short overview of the newly implemented standalone applications.
And their corresponding servers.

#Pair 1

*Client->GM Application:

Name: DtlspClientGroupOSCORE
Security protocol: DTLS
Security type: PSK
CWT protection: PSK
Run with: TestDtlspRSGroupOSCORE

*GM Application:

Name: TestDtlspRSGroupOSCORE
Security protocol: DTLS
Security type: PSK / RPK(?)
CWT protection: PSK / RPK(?)


#Pair 2

*Client->AS Application:

Name: CoAPClientGroupOSCORE
Security protocol: DTLS
Security type: PSK & RPK
CWT protection: PSK
Run with: CoapASTestServerGroupOSCORE

*AS Application:

Name: CoapASTestServerGroupOSCORE
Security protocol: DTLS
Security type: PSK / RPK
CWT protection: PSK / RPK(?)


#Pair 3

*Client->AS & Client->GM Application:

Work in progress. Seems to work now after some
modifications regarding Token encryption/signing,
setting the audience and configuring the GM.

Note that 9 JUnit tests broke and are not working
after work on this.

Name: DtlsAsRsClientGroupOSCORE
Security protocol: DTLS
Security type: PSK & (RKP for Client->AS)
CWT protection: PSK
Run with: CoapASTestServerGroupOSCORE & TestDtlspRSGroupOSCORE
(Be careful to set the AS & RS ports so they do not overlap)


#Pair 4

*Client->GM Application (OSCORE):

Code for testing with Peter van der Stok during Hackathon.
OSCORE Client->GM and GM applications. The client generates its own Token followed
by posting it and performing the Join process.

TODO: Add note about changes from Hackathon
TODO: Make a copy of this as a JUnit.

Name: TestOSCoreRSGroupOSCORE
Security protocol: OSCORE
CWT protection: PSK
Run with: OSCoreClientGroupOSCORE

*GM Application (OSCORE):

Name: OSCoreClientGroupOSCORE
Security protocol: OSCORE
CWT protection: PSK


#Pair 5

*Client->GM Application (OSCORE) (old):

Older code starting from DTLS-base. Works but only when using bypass method.

Name: AltTestOSCoreRSGroupOSCORE
Security protocol: OSCORE
CWT protection: PSK
Run with: OSCoreClientGroupOSCORE

*GM Application (OSCORE) (old):

Older code starting from DTLS-base. Works but only when using bypass method.
